Situation: To analyze data to pick best 11 combination for the T20 World CUP 2022.

Task: To extract data from web, clean and transform using pandas to ensure it was accurate and ready for analysis. This step is crucial for understanding players performance

Result: Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from ESPNcricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics. Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors,finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match. â—‹ Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the game
